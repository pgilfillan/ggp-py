# ggp-py

Python package for General Game Playing

Aimed to be a more lightweight and flexible alternative to the Java framework 
[GGP-Base](https://github.com/ggp-org/ggp-base). There'll be more focus on integration with libraries such as 
Tensorflow, as well as the ability to easily switch between different GDL variations e.g. GDL-II.

**Currently a WIP, not intended for use yet.**
